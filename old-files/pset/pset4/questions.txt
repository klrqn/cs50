0. How many different colors does each format support?
BMP: Variable, it depends on the number of bits specified in the header. 24bits is most common. 24bit = 16.7 million colors, 32bit = 4.29 billion colors
JPEG: Supports 24bit colors, 16.7
JPEG2000: Supports any color depth! 
PNG: Supports 24bit color depth
GIF: Supports 8bit color depth (256 max)

1. Which of these formats supports animation?
GIF

2. What's the difference between lossy and losssless compression
Lossless writes the data in a more efficient manner without losing any of the original data
Lossy is optimized for file size and quality of the image can be decreased.

3. Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
JPEG

4. What happens, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    i. system modifies the filename's first char to signal that it has been deleted and the directory entry can be recycled. most OS's just remove the fie's reference from teh containing dir.
    ii. The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters. The file's data is never touched.

5. What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
Write NUL bytes (or random characters) to every address on the disk. There's consensus that "overwriting a disk with a few random passes" is sufficient.

6. What’s stdint.h?
lots of typedefs and macros for making integer variables of custom sizes.

7. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
You can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file which is good for things like bitmap headers.

8. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 Appliance.)
BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes
LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes

9. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leadin bytes used to identify file formats 
(with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
Hex:    0x424d
ASCII:  BM
This value is stored in "bfType"

10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file (246 for smiley.bmp).
biSize is the number of bytes in the info header (40 for a bitmap).

11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
For uncompressed RGB bitmaps, if biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom- up DIB with the origin at the lower left corner. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount.

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
If it can't find the file, it will..

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.

15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding = 12, which is a multiple of 4.

16. What does fseek do?
It moves to a specific location in a file.

17. What is SEEK_CUR?
An integer constant which, when used as the 'whence' argument to the fseek or fseeko function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
