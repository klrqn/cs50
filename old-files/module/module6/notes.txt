Every computer connected to the Internet needs a unique address, just like houses that want to receive mail need postal addresses. Where do these addresses come from? There’s a special server on most networks called a DHCP server, which stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which assigns an address each time a new computer joins the local network.
These unique addresses to identify each device on the Internet are called IP addresses (8.8.8.8)
10.#.#.#, 172.16.#.# - 172.31.#.#, or 192.168.#.# are private IP addresses
It’s common to name routers after the nearest airport code or major cities.
traceroute -q 1 www.mit.edu, runs the traceroute program in quiet mode, once, to MIT’s website:

TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is another protocol used with IP on the Internet (you may have seen TCP/IP)
When you request a webpage, or send or receive an email, or any other kind of data on the Internet, it doesn’t come in one huge chunk of bits - instead, it’s broken up into a bunch of packets.
With TCP, we have a set of conventional port numbers associated with certain services.
Port Numbers:
21 FTP - file transfer protocol (assigned port 21 a looong time ago)
25 SMTP - (for outbound email)
53 DNS - 
80 HTTP - 
443 HTTPS - (secure)

Modern home networks consist of access points that combine a router, a modem , a switch, and other technologies together in a single device. Modern business networks or large-scale widde-area networks (WANs) still frequently have these as separate devices to allow the size of their network to scale more easily


DEFINITIONS - 
IP Address - Unique Identifier of your computer on a Network (internet protocol)
IPv4 - 32 bit address - 255.255.255.255
IPv6 - 128 bit addresses - a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h. 8 clusters of 16 bytes.
    hexadecimal: 1234:6+89:90ab:cdef:fedc:ba09:8765:4321
    2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844 (google)
    2001:4860:4860::8844 (omitting 0's with double colon)
    
DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server
    somewhere between  your computer and the internet
    has a list of valid IP addresses, assigns you the IP address
    
DNS - Domain Name Systems, translates IP addresses to more memorable names

inter connected network - INTER-NET

TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol - Internet Protocol
    Guarantees Delivery. TCP makes sure all packets are delivered
    
Firewall - A device that all internet traccif at a particular location has to go through, which blocks access to certain sites by blocking outgoing requests to certain IP addresses or ranges.

VPN - Virtual Private Network. gives you an encryupted connection between your computer and a server elsewhere

Port Number - how a specific service, or utility, or program is identified on a machine
Couple an IP address with a Port Number, we can identify a particular service running on a particular machine _ TCP DOES THIS.
TCP also guarantees deliver of packets. does this by including information about how many packets the receiver should get and in what order.
TCP - What port is this going to, in what order.
IP - Gets those Data Packets, what IP address(machine) is getting this data?
                                                (IP(TCP(Data)))

GET is the type of request that a browser sends to a server to get information.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
...                     simple msg would be opened by the server
                        the "/" after GET is just asking for the Root Directory
                        HTTP/1.1 means we're using version 1.1 or HTTP 

Message back as response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
...                     first line confirms we're using version 1.1 to communicate
                        200 is status code that means OK: it has what we're looking for
Other Codes:
200 OK
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
500 Internal Server Error

GET disadvantage: every parameter has to be added to the end of the URL
    Bad for Passwords!
    
So we can use a POST request:

POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.facebook.com
...
email=sbb@gmail.com&password=1234

This gives the inputs email&password to facebook's login.php



Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
An Application Protocol, which specifically dictates the format by which clients request web pages from a server, and the format via which servers return information to clients.
